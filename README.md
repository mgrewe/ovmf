# The Open Virtual Mirror Framework (OVMF)


The Open Virtual Mirror Framework (OVMF) is an open source toolbox for virtual mirror experiments in enfacement research and beyond.
The OVMF can track a large range of facial movements, including head pose and facial expressions.
The tracked movements can be manipulated on-the-fly and used to animate realistic avatar faces.

The OVMF has been designed to run on standard computer hardware.
It easily interfaces with existing toolboxes for psychological experimentation like PsychoPy, and satisfies the requirement of a tightly controlled experimental setup.
The OVMF is designed for convenient extension facilitating the implementation of a large range of experimental paradigms.

# Installation

We developed the OVMF for the Linux and Windows operating system, but it should be simple to use it on Mac, as well.
Please refer to the [installation instructions](./INSTALLATION.md).

# OVMF Avatars {#get-avatars}

The avatars used in our evaluation study of the OVMF were created with our 3D Facial Expression Morphable (FexMM).
The FexMM may only be used for scientific purposes.
To obtain the avatars, please read and sign the [license agreement](data/fexmm_license_agreement.pdf) and send it to us.

More details on the FexMM can be found here:
